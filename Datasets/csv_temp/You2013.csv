As a pilot analysis, we collected 15,000 text records consisting of titles, tags, descriptions, and comments for the thirty most populous cities in the United States. Parsed text was utilized to calculate happiness scores (H-Score) by matching text extracted from Flickr.com with a happiness index dictionary. In addition, we examined the relationships between the calculated Hscores and real world phenomena including population, crime rate, and climate. Based on this pilot analysis, a future study is planed that involves a large dataset with prediction analysis.","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lls&AN=115251541"
