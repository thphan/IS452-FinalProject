ABSTRACT
This poster describes a methodology to numerically
represent the happiness of a city by mining user generated
terms in Flickr.com. As a pilot analysis, we collected
15,000 text records consisting of titles, tags, descriptions,
and comments for the thirty most populous cities in the
United States. Parsed text was utilized to calculate
happiness scores (H-Score) by matching text extracted from
Flickr.com with a happiness index dictionary. In addition,
we examined the relationships between the calculated Hscores
and real world phenomena including population,
crime rate, and climate. Based on this pilot analysis, a
future study is planed that involves a large dataset with
prediction analysis.
Keywords
Flickr.com, social media mining, happiness index, text
mining.
INTRODUCTION
Social media mining is an emerging field whose
applications are widespread. Various text mining
techniques make it possible to find secondary information
from users' communications over social media sites. In
particular, social media mining has been used to explain
different social phenomena in the real world. For example,
text from social media sites has been utilized to predict
political outcomes (Lee et al., 2013), movie box office
revenues (Asur & Huberman, 2010), disaster planning (Yin
et al., 2012), disease outbreaks (Culotta, 2010), and to
analyze public sentiment to predict the stock market
(Bollen, Mao, & Zeng, 2011). Moreover, social media data
imply user behavior and researchers have tried to model
everyday behavior of a certain user group. For example,
Twitter text was analyzed to describe the general behavior
patterns of a group of people engaged in various ativities,
such as when they are eating, working, or shopping (Lee,
Wakimiya, & Sumiya, 2013).
Sentiment analysis has been also applied in the text analysis
of social media. As social media data include users' real
words, it typically contains sentiment information that
represents the negative and positive status of specific
objects. Researchers have tried to classify social media
postings based on their sentiment characteristics. Popular
text mining techniques, such as Naive Bayes and Maximum
Entropy models, have been frequently employed in
sentiment analysis of social media text (Parikh &
Movassate, 2009). In a similar line, Wang et al. (2011)
explored different relationships of Twitter hashtags at the
sentiment level, and proposed a method of sentiment
classification of topics.
In this way, social media mining has become a popular
method to predict future outcomes or to gain a better
understanding of the relationships that exists in various
social phenomena. Sentiment analysis can be carried out
since the nature of social media text involves users'
sentiment. However, there is relatively less research that
predicts real world phenomena based on sentiment analysis.
This poster describes our methodological framework that
intends to provide various prediction models based on
social media mining. We plan on the analysis of user
generated text of Flickr.com and suggest different
prediction models. In this pilot analysis, we tested the
calculation method of happiness score with a small dataset
of user terms in Flickr.com. In addition, we tested an
examination of the relationships between the sentiment
information encoded within Flickr data and crime rates,
population, and climate data.
METHODOLOGY
Data Collection
For the pilot test purpose, we generated a small set of data
in this pilot analysis. Based on the US Census, we selected
the top thirty most populated cities as of July, 2012 for the
test dataset (US Census Bureau, 2012). Using the selected

cities as a keyword, user text from Flickr.com was
harvested. Two Flickr APIs were used to collect the
following information: (1) titles, tags, and descriptions
(flickr.photos.search); and (2) comments for each picture
(flickr.photos.comments.getList). For each city, the first
500 results of the API, sorted by date posted after Jan 1,
2013, were used in this study. In total, 15,000 records of
titles, tags, descriptions and comments were collected (500
records per city * 30 cities).
The R open-source software (www.r-project.org) was used
to prepare the data and create a term-document matrix in
order to determine a happiness index score for each city.
The corpus was established by gathering the title,
description, tags, and user comments together for each of
the thirty cities in the study. Prior to creating the term
document matrix, the data was cleansed by removing all
punctuation, numbers, white space, and stopwords. The
stopwords removed are a standard set of English stopwords
derived from a built-in function of the R software “tm”
module.
The other side of dataset consists of real world phenomena.
As a pilot text, we selected crime rate, population, and
climate data. As to crime rate data, the FBI website was
consulted to collect violent crime data for the thirty cities in
the study. Data from 2011 was the most recent data that
was able to be obtained (FBI, 2011a). The FBI dataset
provides data for both the Metropolitan Statistical Area as
well as for the cities proper. For this study, the crime data
for the city proper was used. The FBI defines violent crime
as “composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated
assault. Violent crimes are defined in the UCR Program as
those offenses which involve force or threat of force” (FBI,
2011b, para 2). For the climate data, we used data from the
National Climate Data Center, which provides the annual
average high and low temperature for US cities based on a
the years 1981-2010. The dataset also contains precipitation
data for cities, which includes the average number of days
per year of precipitation as well as the average total inches
of precipitation per year (National Climatic Data Center,
2011). Additionally, US Census data was used for
population information (US Census Bureau, 2012).
Data Analysis
The most fundamental step of this study is to calculate the
sentiment score of each city based on Flickr text mining.
We decided to use a sentiment term dictionary to
numerically represent a happiness level of a certain city.
The labMT 1.0 dictionary of happiness index created by
Dodds et. al (2011) was selected for our study. The labMT
1.0 dictionary was developed by using the crowdsourcing
power of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The researchers built
a corpus composed of 10,222 unique words derived from a
synthesis of the 5,000 most frequently occurring words in
Twitter, Google Books (English), music lyrics (1960 to
2007), and the New York Times (1987 to 2007) (Dodds et.
al, 2011). For each word in the corpus, the average of 50
independent 9-point scale sentiment evaluations was used
to provide a numeric value.
The term-document matrix of Flickr text was matched with
the happiness dictionary score. Since the size of collected
terms varied by cities, the frequency was standardized to a
percentage. The extracted terms were matched with the
happiness scores of the dictionary and were then
transformed to z-scores for standardization. We calculated
the happiness score, H-Score, for each city by multiplying
the standardized term frequency and the z-transformed
happiness index. Then, the relationships between calculated
H-Scores and selected associated variables were analyzed
based on correlation coefficients (Pearson r). The selected
associated variables are: population, population density,
crime rate, and precipitation. Due to the limited sample size,
prediction models, such as multiple regression or kernel
regression, are not yet tested.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS
This poster presents preliminary results with the limited
data as a pilot test. Table 1 shows the H-Scores calculated
for each city. In this pilot analysis, two cities, Nashville and
Phoenix, which had less than 2,000 terms matching with the
dictionary, were excluded. The text collected from
Charlotte, Louisville, Columbus, Portland, and Denver
ranked 1st to fifth respectively in regards to positive terms.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, New York City, San
Antonio, and San Jose showed the lowest happiness term
score. In particular, negative terms were most observed in
user generated text related to the cities of San Antonio and
San Jose.

More importantly, this study plans to compare happiness
term occurrence with various variables related to cities.
This study selected eight variables as examples. As shown
in Table 2, Pearson r coefficients were computed between
happiness term scores and the selected variables. Population
and population density are negatively associated with
happiness term scores. Also, crime rate has a slight negative
relationship with H-Scores. Temperature showed negative
association with happiness term scores, while precipitation
exhibited a positive relationship.

CONCLUSION
This study is an initial attempt to investigate user generated
text in Flickr.com to reveal relationships between social
media text and real world phenomena based on sentiments.
This pilot test shows that happiness term scores are
calculable based on the analysis of user terms collected
from Flickr.com. As happiness level can be represented by
a numerical index, we can further analyze the relationships
between social media text and other real world data,
particularly using prediction models.
This study establishes a methodology for using social media
mining and sentiment analysis to develop an understanding
of the factors that contribute to the well-being of urban
cities. This information could be valuable to people
seeking to relocate, such as retirees or job-seekers, as well
as to policy makers working to improve the well-being of
their communities. By unobtrusively using user generated
text, hidden relationships between aspects of city life such
crime and climate and the happiness of those places can be
revealed that may not always be intuitive.
Because of its limited data size, the preliminary results
presented in this poster are not yet reliable. Again, the
purpose of this poster is to introduce the methodology to
produce prediction models using Flickr data.
FUTURE STUDY
This pilot study describes the methodology we are going to
use for a larger study. Our major research idea is to
empirically prove whether user generated text from social
media sites would be useful to estimate various phenomena
in the real world. In the future study, of course, our sample
will be enlarged to better represent user wordings in social
media. We plan to collect about 30,000 records per city
including titles, description, tags, and comments. More
importantly, prediction models will be employed, especially
multiple regression and nonparametric regression.
Additionally, a wide variety of text mining techniques will
be applied such as clustering, semantic analysis, and topic
modeling.
