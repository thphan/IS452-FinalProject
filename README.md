# IS452-FinalProject
## 1.	Project Overview

In the final project, I want to build a Python program which can provide different functionalities for a paper collection such as building the collection automatically add paper, update paper, delete paper and search for paper in the collection as well as extract data out of the collection. 

## 2.	Module requirement
List of built in modules in PyCharm required for the project: os, csv, re.

import os

import csv

import re

List of modules need to be installed in PyCharm so that the program can be run: matplotlib, networkx.

import networkx as nx

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


## 3.	Datasets
The datasets used for the final project contain 8 ASIST conference papers belonging to Library and Information Science Source downloaded from EBSCOhost http://search.ebscohost.com 

Each paper is downloaded both fulltext in pdf format (saved in Datasets/pdf/) and csv file (saved in Datasets/csv/) containing basic information about the paper such as Author, Article Title, Publication Date, ISBN, ISSN,â€¦

The pdf fulltext is then copied into txt file (saved in Datasets/txt/) for processing in the Python program. 

Both txt and csv files should be named similarly; for example, Chong2016.txt and Chong2016.csv.

## 4. How to run the program?
- If you have any new files for datasets, make sure the csv and txt versions have the same name and are saved in Datasets/csv and Datasets/txt respectively.
- Make sure the required modules are installed.
- Run the file FinalProject.py. Choose the option you want from 0 to 8. If you want to quit, press q or Q.
